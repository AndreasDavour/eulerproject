;;;; Problem 4 - Largest palindrome product

;;; A palindromic number reads the same both ways. The largest palindrome
;;; made from the product of two 2-digit numbers is 9009 = 91 Ã— 99.
;;; 
;;; Find the largest palindrome made from the product of two 3-digit numbers.

;; 993*913 = 906609
;; 995 x 583 = 580085
