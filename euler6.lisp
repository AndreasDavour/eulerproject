;;;; Problem 6 - Sum square difference

;;; The sum of the squares of the first ten natural numbers is,
;;; 1^2 + 2^2 + ... + 10^2 = 385
;;; 
;;; The square of the sum of the first ten natural numbers is,
;;; (1 + 2 + ... + 10)^2 = 55^2 = 3025
;;; 
;;; Hence the difference between the sum of the squares of the first ten
;;; natural numbers and the square of the sum is 3025 âˆ’ 385 = 2640.
;;; 
;;; Find the difference between the sum of the squares of the first one
;;; hundred natural numbers and the square of the sum.
